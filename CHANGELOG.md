- change behaviour when Study PID Agency is not specified. Before: '10.5279/DK-SA-DDA-868 (not available)'. After: '10.5279/DK-SA-DDA-868 (Agency not available)' ([#156](https://bitbucket.org/cessda/cessda.cdc.version2/issues/156))

### Deprecated
- N/A

### Removed

- caches of RuntimeException in ESIngestService
- option to disable HTTPS verification
- unnecessary null check

### Fixed
- compiler warnings, as recommended by Error Prone
- time zone bugs
- logging pattern for the file logger
- unused micrometer dependencies
- unused DocumentBuilder bean
- issues reported by SonarQube
- test data to match changes made to the expected conditions ('not available' -> 'Agency not available')

- encoded the resumption token in case characters invalid for URIs are returned
- time zone bugs

### Security
- verify SSL
- removed the option to disable HTTPS verification
